DESIGN WEB NOTES!
WHAT IT INCLUDES:
-Instructions
-Code Examples and what it means
-Writing Code without GitHub






NOTES!!!
Goals: Deliver a message using the principles of Design, Typography, Color, Contrast, 
	Layout and Composition (as read and reviewed in previous projects.



											    TYPOGRAPHY 
										is the style or appearance of text

--Common types of fonts: 
-Serif [little strokes called serifs]
-San Serif [doesn't have the small strokes]
-Display Fonts [because they are decorative they are used for more design purposes, not paragraphs]

Fonts that will fit the message is very important
-Use one or two fonts no more than that
-OPPOSITES ATTRACT: thin and bold, short and tall, classy and simple

HIERARCHY: tells the reader where to go, from start to finish
-to make this work, make the text you want people to focus on stand out

LEADING: space between lines of text

TRACKING: character spacing; for example T R A C K I N G

KERNING: space between the letters them self instead of the whole text


												COLOR
											Color Theory is used
NOTES!!!
THE BASICS: Primary and Secondary Color

HUE: its another word for color

SATURATION: intensity of the color, more subtle or vibrant

VALUE: this is how dark or how light the color is

MONOCHROMATIC: Variation of the same color

ANALOGOUS: colors that are beside each other, that work together

COMPLEMENTARY: colors that are across from each other

SPLIT COMPLEMENTARY: uses the colors that are on the side of the original complementary colors. For example red orange and red violet with green

TRIADIC: uses three colors that are evenly spaced

TETRADIC: for a rectangle on the color wheel, it is used for one color to standout and the other ones to be accents

DO's AND DONT'S
READABILITY: making the text and design readable, not using to much color, but using the right ones that send the message that is desired
EXPERIMENTING will bring great IDEAS!!!! LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLES WORK!!


											LAYOUT & COMPOSITION
								Composition isn't just working with text, think like a designer
NOTES!!!!

1) PROXIMITY: using visual space to show relationship in a design, related and similar designs should be grouped together
2) WHITE SPACE: spaces that are between content, letting your design breathe.
3) ALIGNMENT: aligning text, object and pics so they are all in unison. Inconsistent alignment can cause disorder and confusion in the reader.
4) CONTRAST: one item is different from another. Catch the readers eye, provide emphasis, or have them focus on something specific.
---> use can do this with color, text, boldness
---> Goes along with Hierarchy, guiding the viewer where to go. The designer will guide their eyes
5) REPETITION: repeat the same elements, colors, text used for the whole project.

GETTING THIS DOWN WILL MAKE DESIGNS LOOK PROFESSIONAL, CLEAN AND UNDERSTANDABLE.
